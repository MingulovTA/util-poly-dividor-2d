# util-poly-dividor-2d
A long time ago I came across the idea of ​​optimizing a level by combining several UV into one, but in this case we lose such a rendering feature as tiling.

I tried to come up with a way to bypass this limitation, but to solve this problem first for 2D. This code represents my ideas for dividing polygons into subtriangles for further rebuilding the UV and combining the meshes. The program works, but the code quality leaves much to be desired.

Best wishes.
Timur.
